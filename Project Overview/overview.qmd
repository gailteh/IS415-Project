# 1. Theme: Spatial Points Analysis on URA Parking in Singapore

# 2. Abstract

To use geospatial analysis to analyze the spatial characteristics of Singapore's parking lots and to pinpoint hot and cold regions in order to guide management and allocation decisions.

Our application enables users to derive insights from Point pattern analysis using Spatial Patterns Analysis and Hot Spot and Cold Spot Analysis (HCSA). It is helpful in uncovering whether the input data will be in regular, or clustered patterns or randomly distributed; or whether the distributions of data are dependent on each other. For HCSA, is useful to uncover the statistically significant hot spots and cold spots.

In addition, our application can generate kernel density maps using the input datasets of car parks and run a range of hypothesis tests to derive meaningful conclusions on the distributions of car parks in Singapore. To better visualise how our application would work and look like, we have storyboards to depict the proposed application UI format.

# 3. Problem and Motivation

Singapore is a densely populated city-state that faces the challenge of providing adequate and efficient car park facilities to its residents and visitors.The spatial distribution of car parks across the city is uneven, with some areas experiencing high demand while others have surplus capacity.

Geospatial analysis can help identify hot spots and cold spots of car parks, which are areas with high and low concentrations of car parks, respectively. Understanding these patterns can inform policies and decisions related to the allocation and management of car park facilities, such as identifying areas in need of additional car parks or adjusting parking rates in areas with high demand.

Therefore, the problem statement is to investigate the spatial patterns of car parks in Singapore using geospatial analysis and identify hot spots and cold spots to observe car park allocation.

# 4. Project Objectives

In this project, we will be proposing to create an analytic application that allows users to:

-   Better understand the capabilities and use cases of Point Pattern Analysis in the case of Car parks in Singapore

-   Conduct Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (Kernel density estimation and, G and L functions)

-   Conduct Hot Spot and Cold Spot Analysis

Use these insights derived from the analysis for better understanding on the distribution of car parks in Singapore.

-   Inspect and understand the data fields
-   Data Wrangling - Missing values - Duplicates

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Summary:

-   MBGapp is a Shiny Web Application that can be used to teach the different stages of a geostatistical analysis. In this case study, they make use of the Loa loa (eyeworm) data from Cameroon to analyse its rate of infection. Through this model-based geostatistics (MBG) study, they are able to study the public health problems by using spatially discrete survey data to investigate spatial variation in disease risk.

### Learning Points:

-   MBGapp has a sidebar which has a 'upload data' functionality which allows users to upload their file in CSV format. Users are also prompted about the projection format so that the coordinates displayed can be accurate.

-   There are various tabs to view the distribution such as 'Explore', 'Variogram', 'Estimation', 'Prediction' and 'Report' to use for all-rounded analysis.

### Linking back to our project:

-   We will ensure that users are able to upload their data properly for analysis

-   We could have different tabs for different functions to serve various purposes.

## 2. [Spatial Point Analysis of Carpark Vacancies in Singapore](https://jesuscaro.org/portfolio/carpark/)

![](images/image-1631201293.png)

### Summary

-   The writer conducted geospatial analysis on the availability of parking spaces in carparks in Singapore, and then built a tool to allow drivers to have a better visualisation and sense of parking space availability of their intended carpark.

### Learning Points

-   The study split the availability into 3 categories (Low, Mid, High). The study analysed the availability of different carparks within a day and segregated it between business hours and non-business hours

<!-- -->

-   They did a visualisation of the carpark availability across Singapore across both business and non-business hours.

### Linking back to our project

-   We can include a similar analysis into our application solution. For our solution, we allow users to visualise the full capacities of carparks across Singapore. We can also visualise other amenities around the carparks to help them have a better sense of the area.

## 3. [Spatial disparities of self-reported COVID-19 cases and influencing factors in Wuhan, China](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8545724/)

![](images/img(covid).jpg)

### Summary

-   Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method to investigate variations in the intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic across different spatial regions. Additionally, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to assess how the population dynamics, transportation and social interactions contributed to the spread of the COVID-19.

### Learning Points

-   Factors such as population density, transportation and social interactions greatly influence the choice of setting up health facilities that is crucial. Because the regions with elevated morbidity rates are predominantly located in commercial hubs and densely populated residential areas with greater population densities and more frequent social interactions.

### Linking back to our project

-   We will offer a range of bandwidth values to enable to select the most suitable option for analysis

-   A functionality will be incorporated to aid users in comprehending the outcomes of their statistical analysis and functions.
