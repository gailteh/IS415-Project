# 1. Theme: Spatial Points Analysis on URA Parking in Singapore

# 2. Abstract

To use geospatial analysis to analyze the spatial characteristics of HDB parking lot with other interest in the nehgbourhoods in Singapore.

Our application enables users to derive insights from Point pattern analysis using Spatial Patterns Analysis and Local Colocation Quotient (LCLQ). It is helpful in uncovering whether the input data will be in regular, or clustered patterns or randomly distributed; or whether the distributions of data are dependent on each other. As for Local Colocation Quotient (LCLQ), it is useful in discovering the spatial association between HDB carparks and other interests like HDB, shopping malls and hawker centres.

In addition, our application can generate kernel density maps using the input datasets of car parks and run a range of hypothesis tests to derive meaningful conclusions on the distributions of car parks in Singapore. To better visualise how our application would work and look like, we have storyboards to depict the proposed application UI format.

# 3. Problem and Motivation

Singapore is a densely populated city-state that faces the challenge of providing adequate and efficient car park facilities to its residents and visitors.The spatial distribution of car parks across the city is uneven, with some areas experiencing high demand while others have surplus capacity.

Our project aims to find out the spatial patterns of HDB carparks and its local colocation with other interests like HDB, shopping malls and hawker centres.

The problem statement is focused on exploring the spatial points patterns of HDB carparks within neighbourhood in Singapore.

# 4. Project Objectives

In this project, we will be proposing to create an analytic application that allows users to:

-   Better understand the capabilities and use cases of Point Pattern Analysis in the case of Car parks in Singapore

-   Conduct Spatial Point Patterns Analysis

    -   1st Order (Kernel density estimation)

    -   2nd Order Spatial Points Analysis (G and L functions)

    -   Local Colocation Quotients (LCLQ)

Use these insights derived from the analysis for better understanding on the distribution of car parks in Singapore.

# 7. Approach and Methodology

### Data Preparation

-   Importing in data
-   Inspect and understand the data fields
-   Data Wrangling - Missing values - Duplicates

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   Examine distribution of data points
-   Check for outliers and anomalies in data
-   Additional Data Wrangling if necessary

### Point Pattern Analysis

-   Spatial Point Patterns Analysis: First-order and Second-order analysis

-   Kernel Density Estimation: Visualise and explore the intensity of points cluster

-   G-Function: Find out if the points are of either clustered pattern, regular pattern of randomly distributed pattern.

-   L-Function: Discover if the target point locations are independent from other points' locations

![](images/image-751352976.png)

### Summary:

-   MBGapp is a Shiny Web Application that can be used to teach the different stages of a geostatistical analysis. In this case study, they make use of the Loa loa (eyeworm) data from Cameroon to analyse its rate of infection. Through this model-based geostatistics (MBG) study, they are able to study the public health problems by using spatially discrete survey data to investigate spatial variation in disease risk.

### Learning Points:

-   MBGapp has a sidebar which has a 'upload data' functionality which allows users to upload their file in CSV format. Users are also prompted about the projection format so that the coordinates displayed can be accurate.

-   There are various tabs to view the distribution such as 'Explore', 'Variogram', 'Estimation', 'Prediction' and 'Report' to use for all-rounded analysis.

### Linking back to our project:

-   We will ensure that users are able to upload their data properly for analysis

-   We could have different tabs for different functions to serve various purposes.

## 2. [Analysing the global and local spatial associations of medical resources across Wuhan city using POI data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9883876/)

![](images/image-1276833123.png)

### Summary

-   This article is about how colocation quotients are used to identify co-location between different medical resources in Wuhan from the global and local perspective.

-   LCLQ is a better analysis tool compared to GLCQ

### Learning Points

-   The colocation quotient between several categories is more suited for urban analytics in contrast to other methods for evaluating spatial connection (such as Moran's I for interval and ratio data).

-   The global colocation quotient (GCLQ) does not take spatial heterogeneity into account, it evaluates the direction and intensity of the global spatial connections between medical resources within and between categories throughout the research area (nonstationary colocation).

-   The power of the LCLQ is its ability to map the direction and intensity of local spatial associations, i.e., colocation within a local neighbourhood. Compared with the global colocation quotient, the LCLQ also produces maps that are easier to interpret.

### Linking back to our project

We will apply the LCLQ to identify colocation between HDB carparks and different types of facilities in the neighbourhoods (e.g. HDB Buildings, Hawker Centers and Shopping Malls)

## 3. [Spatial disparities of self-reported COVID-19 cases and influencing factors in Wuhan, China](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8545724/)

![](images/img(covid).jpg)

### Summary

-   Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method to investigate variations in the intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic across different spatial regions. Additionally, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to assess how the population dynamics, transportation and social interactions contributed to the spread of the COVID-19.

### Learning Points

-   Factors such as population density, transportation and social interactions greatly influence the choice of setting up health facilities that is crucial. Because the regions with elevated morbidity rates are predominantly located in commercial hubs and densely populated residential areas with greater population densities and more frequent social interactions.

### Linking back to our project

-   We will offer a range of bandwidth values to enable to select the most suitable option for analysis

-   A functionality will be incorporated to aid users in comprehending the outcomes of their statistical analysis and functions.
