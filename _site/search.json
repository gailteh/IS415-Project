    "text": "1) A Shiny Web Application for teaching model-based geostatistics to population health scientists\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nMBGapp is a Shiny Web Application that can be used to teach the different stages of a geostatistical analysis. In this case study, they make use of the Loa loa (eyeworm) data from Cameroon to analyse its rate of infection. Through this model-based geostatistics (MBG) study, they are able to study the public health problems by using spatially discrete survey data to investigate spatial variation in disease risk.\n\n\n\nLearning Points:\n\nMBGapp has a sidebar which has a ‘upload data’ functionality which allows users to upload their file in CSV format. Users are also prompted about the projection format so that the coordinates displayed can be accurate.\nThere are various tabs to view the distribution such as ‘Explore’, ‘Variogram’, ‘Estimation’, ‘Prediction’ and ‘Report’ to use for all-rounded analysis.\n\n\n\nLinking back to our project:\n\nWe will ensure that users are able to upload their data properly for analysis\nWe could have different tabs for different functions to serve various purposes."

Analysing the global and local spatial associations of medical resources across Wuhan city using POI data\n\n\nSummary\n\nThis article is about how colocation quotients are used to identify co-location between different medical resources in Wuhan from the global and local perspective.\nLCLQ is a better analysis tool compared to GLCQ\n\n\n\nLearning Points\n\nThe colocation quotient between several categories is more suited for urban analytics in contrast to other methods for evaluating spatial connection (such as Moran’s I for interval and ratio data).\nThe global colocation quotient (GCLQ) does not take spatial heterogeneity into account, it evaluates the direction and intensity of the global spatial connections between medical resources within and between categories throughout the research area (nonstationary colocation).\nThe power of the LCLQ is its ability to map the direction and intensity of local spatial associations, i.e., colocation within a local neighbourhood. Compared with the global colocation quotient, the LCLQ also produces maps that are easier to interpret.\n\n\n\nLinking back to our project\nWe will apply the LCLQ to identify colocation between HDB carparks and different types of facilities in the neighbourhoods (e.g. HDB Buildings, Hawker Centers and Shopping Malls)"

Additionally, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to assess how the population dynamics, transportation and social interactions contributed to the spread of the COVID-19.\n\n\n\nLearning Points\n\nFactors such as population density, transportation and social interactions greatly influence the choice of setting up health facilities that is crucial. Because the regions with elevated morbidity rates are predominantly located in commercial hubs and densely populated residential areas with greater population densities and more frequent social interactions.\n\n\n\nLinking back to our project\n\nWe will offer a range of bandwidth values to enable to select the most suitable option for analysis\nA functionality will be incorporated to aid users in comprehending the outcomes of their statistical analysis and functions."
