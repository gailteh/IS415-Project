    "text": "1) A Shiny Web Application for teaching model-based geostatistics to population health scientists\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\nMBGapp is a Shiny Web Application that can be used to teach the different stages of a geostatistical analysis. In this case study, they make use of the Loa loa (eyeworm) data from Cameroon to analyse its rate of infection. Through this model-based geostatistics (MBG) study, they are able to study the public health problems by using spatially discrete survey data to investigate spatial variation in disease risk.\n\n\nLearning Points:\n\nMBGapp has a sidebar which has a ‘upload data’ functionality which allows users to upload their file in CSV format. Users are also prompted about the projection format so that the coordinates displayed can be accurate.\nThere are various tabs to view the distribution such as ‘Explore’, ‘Variogram’, ‘Estimation’, ‘Prediction’ and ‘Report’ to use for all-rounded analysis.\n\n\n\nLinking back to our project:\n\nWe will ensure that users are able to upload their data properly for analysis\nWe could have different tabs for different functions to serve various purposes."

Spatial Point Analysis of Carpark Vacancies in Singapore\n\n\nSummary\nThe writer conducted geospatial analysis on the availability of parking spaces in carparks in Singapore, and then built a tool to allow drivers to have a better visualisation and sense of parking space availability of their intended carpark.\n\n\nLearning Points\n\nThe study split the availability into 3 categories (Low, Mid, High). The study analysed the availability of different carparks within a day and segregated it between business hours and non-business hours\n\n\n\nThey did a visualisation of the carpark availability across Singapore across both business and non-business hours.\n\n\n\nLinking back to our project\nWe can include a similar analysis into our application solution. For our solution, we allow users to visualise the full capacities of carparks across Singapore. We can also visualise other amenities around the carparks to help them have a better sense of the area."
