### Summary: 

MBGapp is a Shiny Web Application that can be used to teach the different stages of a geostatistical analysis. In this case study, they make use of the Loa loa (eyeworm) data from Cameroon to analyse its rate of infection. Through this model-based geostatistics (MBG) study, they are able to study the public health problems by using spatially discrete survey data to investigate spatial variation in disease risk.

### Learning Points:

-   MBGapp has a sidebar which has a 'upload data' functionality which allows users to upload their file in CSV format. Users are also prompted about the projection format so that the coordinates displayed can be accurate.

-   There are various tabs to view the distribution such as 'Explore', 'Variogram', 'Estimation', 'Prediction' and 'Report' to use for all-rounded analysis.

### Linking back to our project

-   We will ensure that users are able to upload their data properly for analysis

-   We could have different tabs for different functions to serve various purposes.
